		<p class="mt-6 text-neutral-600">
			Hi, I'm a web developer who enjoys building clean, reliable, and purposeful applications. Over
			the past couple of years, I’ve worked across the frontend and backend, helping shape
			everything from corporate websites to data-driven tools used in bioinformatics.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
			I did my bachelor's in
			<span title="History, Political Science, & Public Administration">Arts [B.A.]</span>, but
			found myself drawn to the logic and creativity of the web. During my second year — around the
			COVID lockdown — I began learning <span class="bg-slate-100 px-1 font-mono">HTML</span>,
			<span class="bg-slate-100 px-1 font-mono">CSS</span>, and
			<span class="bg-slate-100 px-1 font-mono">JavaScript</span> through online tutorials, YouTube channels,
			and documentation. The internet became my classroom, and I learned by building, breaking, and debugging
			my way through small projects. What started as curiosity quickly became a daily habit — and by
			the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to build for the web professionally.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
			That journey of self-driven learning turned into real-world work.
