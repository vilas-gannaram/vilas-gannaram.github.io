	<li>
		Built a unified federated UI for 13 specialized bioinformatics agents, enabling researchers to
		orchestrate complex, cross-domain scientific workflows within a single Next.js ecosystem.
	</li>
	<li>
		Developed a tool-rendering engine that automatically maps heterogeneous agent outputs—including
		Molstar protein structures and Plotly genomic plots—into a standardized, interactive UI
		framework.
	</li>
	<li>
		Engineered a high-performance SSE streaming pipeline with token reconciliation for flicker-free
		LLM reasoning, coupled with a Zustand rehydration strategy for seamless multi-day session
		persistence.
	</li>
	<li>
		Scaled agent integration via OpenAPI-generated SDKs and a modular Shadcn/UI + MDX component
		library, reducing frontend feature-delivery time by 25%.
