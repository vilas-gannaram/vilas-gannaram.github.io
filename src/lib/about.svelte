	<!-- <h3 class="border-b">About Me</h3> -->

	<p class="mt-4 md:mt-6">
		I am a Full-Stack Developer with 3 years of experience building and shipping web applications. I
		focus on the entire lifecycle of a feature—from building responsive UI components to writing the
		APIs and handling the data integration that connects them.

		<br />
		<br />

		I’ve spent the last few years working on a variety of projects, including corporate platforms,
		LLM-integrated chat tools, and data-driven applications for the biotech sector. I enjoy the
		challenge of taking a complex requirement and breaking it down into a functional, end-to-end
		solution.

		<br />
		<br />

		My path into development was non-traditional. I started with a B.A. and taught myself to build
		for the web by digging into documentation and solving real-world bugs. That background has made
		me a developer who is comfortable jumping into unfamiliar codebases, navigating technical debt,
		and learning whatever stack is necessary to get the job done.
