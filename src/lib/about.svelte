		<p>
			I am a Full-Stack Developer with 3 years of experience building and shipping web applications.
			I focus on the entire lifecycle of a feature—from building responsive UI components to writing
			the APIs and handling the data integration that connects them.
		</p>

		<p>
			I’ve spent the last few years working on a variety of projects, including corporate platforms,
			LLM-integrated chat tools, and data-driven applications for the biotech sector. I enjoy the
			challenge of taking a complex requirement and breaking it down into a functional, end-to-end
			solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			My path into development was non-traditional. I started with a B.A. and taught myself to build
			for the web by digging into documentation and solving real-world bugs. That background has
			made me a developer who is comfortable jumping into unfamiliar codebases, navigating technical
			debt, and learning whatever stack is necessary to get the job done.
