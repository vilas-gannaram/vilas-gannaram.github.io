		<p>
			I’m a software engineer focused on building reliable, interactive web applications. My work
			centers on designing systems where interfaces, data flow, and backend services work together
			in a predictable and maintainable way.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have experience developing web platforms that support complex workflows, real-time
			interactions, and data-intensive features. I enjoy shaping software from the ground up —
			structuring the frontend, defining how state and data move through the system, and building
			tools that remain understandable as they grow.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most of my work is in the modern JavaScript ecosystem, particularly React-based frameworks and
			Node.js. I’m especially interested in how applications behave over time — how state stays
			consistent, how asynchronous processes interact, and how systems remain stable under
			real-world usage.
		</p>

		<p>
			I value clear engineering decisions and practical solutions. My goal is to build software that
			is not only functional, but also dependable and easy to reason about.
